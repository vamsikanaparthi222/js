//synchronous :- it will use single-thread only one operation or run at  a time
//synchronous blocking :- it send request to the server but will wait for answer by the server
//it excutes one by one
//Asynchronous :- it is non-blocking , multiple-thread 
//it send also multiple-request to the sever at a time
//it can run multiple operation at a time
//it excutes simultaneously
//why synchronos is not betterthan Asynchronous interms of performance
